# Uno Negativo Initial
Uno Negativo is a clone of the game Uno written entirely in python. This project was conceptualized and created in the 2nd Period Coding I class at Franklin High School. All code in this project was submitted by one of the 4 people listed below. The project was started on April 7, 2021, with the initial deadline set for May 12. Uno Negativo will (probably never) enter beta once the GUI is completed and merged with the game engine.

GUI / Front End:
 Lead - Michael Tindall
 Other - Ellie Bouvier, Caleb Jackson

Game Engine / Backend:
 Lead - Maddox Guthrie

# Uno Negativo Update December 2021
Uno Negativo GUI development has stopped until further notice. The game engine will continue to be updated and intended to run as a command-line application. In the future, development on the game engine will likely slow down or stop as I will be rewriting the game in C++.

# How to use
- `git clone` or download the project.
- Change into the folder
- run `python3 main.py`

# Current Version Changelog
Uno Negativo v0.9.2.1 pre-Alpha
